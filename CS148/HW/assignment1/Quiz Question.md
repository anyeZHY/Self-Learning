## Comparation

- Low resolution leads to a blur and fuzz. It also cause a sawtooth.
- Gamma encoding enable the picture be dim and Gamma correction brighten it.

## Quiz Question

1. How does light interact differently with different objects in real life? Give 3 examples.
   - Reflection, refraction and scatterring effect (the colorful sky).
2. Why do objects appear to have different colors to our eyes?
   - Waves with various wavelengths and energies interact differently with our retinas.
3. What's the advantage of using YUV color space?
   - YUV color-spaces are a more efficient coding and reduce the bandwidth more than RGB capture can.
4. How are colors added differently for lights compared to paint? What does R+G+B equal to in each case?
   - Mixing light together is simple addition. R+B+G = W. Paint, on the other hand, is about absorption and reflection. R+B+G = K.
5. Why do we choose green instead of other colors for chroma keying? Hint: There are a number of practical reasons but one of the reasons comes from how camera sensors interact with green light differently. Think about the arrangement of color filters in front of the camera sensor.
  - The camera sensors had greater sensitivity to green light, which means it was easier to remove a green screen from the shot as opposed to a blue screen.
6. Why is tone mapping needed for HDR images?
   - To reveal their full details and give them a dynamic twist and a realistic look
